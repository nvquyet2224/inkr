                            <p>You've tapped right into my passion point there, immediately out of the gate. I think
                                it's a kind of necessary dissolving of the illusionary boundaries within the creative
                                sector and actually the world at large, that's starting to be addressed through
                                conversations like this and connection points like this. So I really appreciate the
                                invitation and I'm looking forward to discussing these themes with you. </p>
                            <p>When I think of the opportunities for designers, it's huge, and I think the stakes could
                                not be higher in this moment: we currently have a situation where the eight billion
                                people alive on this planet are using 500 billion people's worth of hydrocarbon energy.
                            </p>
                            <p>Many of us are still obsessed with the idea of abundance, but we live on a planet with
                                finite resource so it's not hard to see the flaws in the way that we've been operating,
                                and if I track back through my life, I have been through periods – as we all probably
                                have, alive this far into the 21st century – when you sort of wake up some mornings and
                                you think about the political systems, or the energy systems, or the relationships
                                systems or the food systems, like, take your pick – and there's so many things that seem
                                to be falling apart around us. </p>
                            <p>But I think simultaneously to that, what's actually happening is the planet is becoming
                                more conscious. We're actually experiencing this sort of shift. So, we have this kind of
                                paradox happening, where if you were to take all of the companies currently listed on
                                the NASDAQ; if the environmental cost was accounted for like other forms of capital, 78%
                                of those companies would be considered completely unviable. That means that 78% of
                                everything around us has to change: everything from the microphone I'm speaking into, to
                                the computers and devices that we're using to connect with each other – It has to change
                                in the way that it's produced, operates, and is marketed to the world. </p>
                            <p>So I feel that the revolution of brand which is the area that we kind of focus in – but
                                everything's an application of brand when you think of it these day – I think the
                                revolution of brand and media and communication is absolutely necessary in terms of the
                                evolution of consciousness, and people who create media and brands and communications
                                have got a responsibility to really think about what they're actually creating. They've
                                got to get out of the mindset of thinking that they're passively reflecting culture,
                                because what you choose to create is very, very important in this moment. I think that
                                comes with this responsibility as a designer to think about what you're doing, why
                                you're doing it, who you're doing it with, what you're doing it for. </p>
                            <p>Because ultimately, we're existing in this moment where It's kind of happening in a
                                backdrop of fear and insecurity and negativity: we're distracted, essentially, from
                                what's coming down the track. The media is basically programming our collective
                                consciousness to not be aware of what's happening and facing us and how we need to
                                change. Therefore, the brand systems, the communication systems, the conversation
                                systems, all need to have integrity – and they all need to be created in a way that will
                                have a positive effect on the future. </p>
                            <p>When you think about a brand system or the design work that you actually create you're
                                actually bringing into the world language and symbols which fundamentally change the way
                                we behave in the world around us. That's a superpower – it's a dark art, and it comes
                                with a responsibility. So I really think the opportunity and the responsibility around
                                the way that we operate couldn't be bigger, and it comes at a very high potential cost
                                if we don't start thinking about the cause and effects of our work in this moment.</p>

                            <p>That’s very true. I think design has the power to initiate conversations – it ultimately
                                leads to positive change. But I guess it needs collaborative effort among designers and
                                communities. So how do you think we can make sure there’s collaboration between
                                designers, individuals, policymakers and other stakeholders to drive this change?</p>

                        <div class="text_normal">
                            <p>There's a few things within that as far as I think about it. I saw a brilliant diagram
                                recently that was an upside-down triangle. The top part of the triangle was the people
                                that make policy – the legislators. So they have the biggest power in the world because
                                they tell businesses what to do. So if you imagine a sort of tiered, upside-down
                                triangle you've got the legislators at the top that make policy that affect the
                                businesses, the businesses affect the communities, and the communities affect the
                                citizens. So you have this sort of diminishing agency in the world, the lower down that
                                chain that you get, but you can actually hack that system and there's various different
                                organisations around the world that are exploring this way of kind of going in through
                                community.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>If you think of certain activist groups, they’re basically amassing community to change
                                legislation. They're kind of going in at that third rung on that diagram I described in
                                order to be able to circle back up and change the policy makers, and there's incredible
                                examples of that. The g0v (pronounced “gov zero”) case study in Taiwan I found
                                absolutely fascinating, where they cloned the governmental website and basically
                                open-sourced the opportunity to be able to upvote or downvote government policies. The
                                country en masse engaged with this, and this was something that was not approved by the
                                government of course. In that moment, you had an opportunity to either move the
                                conversation forwards or – what has traditionally happened – to basically clamp down.
                                Thankfully, the Taiwanese government did engage with the g0v movement, and in fact
                                invited them in, and they're now consultants and some of them sit within the
                                government.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>I think this is an incredible example of a rise in citizen thinking: as an individual, as
                                a citizen, you actually have more opportunity than you think sometimes. I think breaking
                                out of this kind of consumer story, this kind of narrative that tells us that we're
                                individual humans, and we have only the agency within the world that we are allowed,
                                rather than the full spectrum of our creative minds and our actions, to be able to
                                individually and en masse affect the greater whole.<br>But there's also companies that
                                can affect legislation, of course, because corporations transcend the geographical
                                borders in which the countries and the legislators operate. So if you're a global system
                                – and this is fraught with issues of course – you can often affect the way the
                                legislators work.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>I think all of it, for me, comes down to your individual perspective. The biggest
                                responsibility, I think, is to work on yourself – the inner workings of yourself. What
                                happens on the micro happens on the macro, and what's happening on our planet is down to
                                what's happening within us. There's kind of a reflection on who and what we are, which
                                is having a very negative effect on the planet. So I think that it kind of starts at
                                home: if you want to affect the planet, you need to really think about your thoughts.
                                You need to think about your actions. You need to think about what's driving those. And
                                then en masse, I love this metaphor of, “if you just look after your jigsaw piece”, then
                                the whole jigsaw will kind of emerge as one, if everybody's doing their bit. I like that
                                because it doesn't feel overwhelming – you just affect the things you can, around you
                                and within yourself, at any given moment, and then we're off and running.</p>

                            <p>I think that’s exactly right – I think if everyone is just held accountable for their
                                personal decisions, collectively it will make a great impact. I think there’s also been
                                a shift in the way consumers interact with brands: I think consumers expect a lot more
                                transparency these days. They want to make sure they’re being ethical in their sourcing
                                of materials, they want to make sure that there are sustainability decisions happening,
                                and I guess they want to make sure that their business decisions align with their
                                personal values. How do you think we can shift or prepare the next generation of
                                designers to tackle challenges for the future?</p>

                            <p>I do think we have to go back to education in many ways. I think there's a glaring lack
                                of diversity in the creative sector that can only be addressed if we go back literally
                                to primary school and start opening up the opportunities at the earliest stage within
                                individuals to say, “Oh, I like the sound of that! I think I can work within that
                                realm…”. But if you don't see it, you can't be it, right? So unless you're actually
                                going and speaking to kids at the early stages, you're just never going to diversify as
                                we need to in the creative sector and inspire a kind of new generation. Collaboration,
                                diversity of thinking, different perspectives, and background: they are all the things
                                that we need for the next generation of the creative sector. and for the most impactful
                                work to be created. But I do think that you can only affect where you're at – so, yes, I
                                can go and speak at a primary school or a secondary school and start to make people
                                aware, but my biggest opportunity is probably to have a positive impact through our
                                partnerships, through the projects that we do, and, of course, through inspiring the
                                team through having a mission to come to work for. I think deep down, nobody really
                                wants a job to just occupy his or her time. I think that we want a mission that inspires
                                us, and there's huge opportunities in this moment for missions that inspire us.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>So, when we think of the next generation of designers, we have to also think of our
                                current role as kind of incumbents within organisations to be setting out the framework
                                that will inspire them. Setting out the framework that is something they want to give
                                their life to, really! The company that is worthy of them, and that they are worthy of,
                                in order to be able to go and live the most fulfilling life that they possibly
                                can.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>I think that being a creator is an incredibly rewarding career path for any, that would
                                like to kind of lead that way, but at the same time it can be incredibly discouraging
                                when you realise that you're using your skills, your attention, for things that don't
                                align with your values. So I think you're right: I think that companies that align with
                                our values are the clearest opportunity to inspire society at mass and inspire the
                                future generations of designers.</p>

                            <p>It definitely requires constant attention. I was thinking recently… we've been working on
                                our five-year plan, and if I think back to the way that we operated five years ago,
                                there are clearly projects that we wouldn't want to do now, and there's certainly ways
                                that we were running those projects that seem naïve –&nbsp;because it was five years
                                ago. And I think the company is always at the top of its game, but I think it's always
                                at the most naïve point that it's ever going to be, if it is an organisation of learning
                                and evolution. So I’ll look back in five years from now and cringe at the things that we
                                are doing now – I'll be like, “What were we thinking?”. But right now, I'm like, “We're
                                top of our game,” because we're being inclusive, and we're really thinking about our
                                future as a group. So I just wanted to kind of start with that kind of awareness around
                                the fact that you need to evolve, but you need to evolve with the awareness that it is
                                an iterative process just like the design process.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>We started a few things over the last few years that have really helped. We began with
                                having a living business plan: the living business plan is a plan that sits alongside
                                our more traditional business plan, and it's in the ecosystem of elements that all
                                coexist. And I kind of see them as themes that mean that when there’s bumps in the road
                                where you suddenly need to really look at the pipeline, or there's concerns because of a
                                pandemic or any of these things that seem to be affecting us these days, you don't
                                forget what you traditionally stood for.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>The first year that we had a living business plan, it was co-defined by the entire team
                                and came through conversations between the entire team, and we had things like ‘love’
                                and ‘death’. Death is an important part of nature: to recognise that death creates space
                                for new life and to recognise that certain relationships must die, and that's okay: they
                                should be honoured, they should be thanked, and hospiced – in the kindest way – out of
                                existence. But you should recognise that moment, and move on. That gives you an agency
                                around the clients you might be working with, or even people that you're working with in
                                partnership, or within the company.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>There were nine key elements within our first living business plan and they've been
                                whittled down over the last three years just to three key elements. But we co-define
                                them every year. Last year, we went away as a team and we stayed for three days in
                                nature in the north of England. And we spent time together where computers were shut and
                                there was no commercial work going on, and we really sat and looked at the company and
                                decided where we come from, thought about how that should inform the future, and defined
                                our next 12 months. And that's something that we repeated this spring.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>I found those are really powerful moments to be very authentically creating this thing
                                together. So, young designers coming in recognise that they have an incredible
                                opportunity to be connected to the wider whole and a responsibility to be pushing that
                                thing forward as much as anybody else. Whether you're a junior designer or the CEO, you
                                will share in this kind of organism that we're pushing forward together.</p>
                            <p>There are various different things that we do in addition to that: I really like to
                                socialise quite a lot. We like to inspire ourselves quite a lot by going out to consume
                                culture in different ways – or ‘absorb’, I should say, not ‘consume’ but just kind of
                                allow ourselves to sort of process what's happening in the world and see how it will
                                inform our work. And then a lot of just spending time together as real people in a real
                                world to go and create positive impact. These are all things that contribute towards
                                culture.</p>
                            <p>It goes up and down: I'm not gonna say that every single month we're just on fire
                                internally around our mission. I think it requires constant attention and consideration
                                and nurturing – it's like a flower that you need to look after, because it's very
                                precious. So it requires constant attention, and that's the thing about culture, within
                                organisations: I think that they're sometimes sort of intangible as to why it's working
                                or why it's not. We can all stand in a company sometimes and just know that it's
                                working, but it's not because of any one reason – it just feels like that's the season
                                or the moment of a positive, galvanised team. But there are certain handrails that you
                                can put in place to try and encourage those circumstances to emerge.</p>

                            <p>Culture can change so quickly – you just need one or two people to get involved, and they

                                guys adhere to keep culture in place, or is it just kind of ‘go with it and see what

                            <p>We have an annual calendar. So, starting with our annual kickoff, where we take time out,
                                usually two to three days, often doing fun things as well as more kind of nuts and bolts
                                of defining our future.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>We encourage, as much as possible, a culture of looking after each other, because in a
                                company of any size really, but certainly in a company that's growing, you will have
                                groups that come together for certain projects or groups that comes together because
                                they live together, or live close together, and there's all of these kind of little
                                clusters of people that we encourage to support each other. Then we do have a process of
                                one-to-one check-ins – So, we do have a form of organisational structure that has
                                certain line managers and things like that throughout the organisation, but we also try
                                to be devolved as much as possible: we’re kind of a centre-outwards structured
                                organisation. Currently one of our junior designers has monthly check-ins with our MD
                                just because they're really interested in having a vantage point on where we're going,
                                and those are incredibly rewarding sessions for both people. So I suppose, wherever we
                                can, breaking down the illusion of hierarchy and really building a culture of supporting
                                each other individually and as a team, and yes, having annual events that bring us
                                together to have the discussions that we need to in order to be able to push things
                                forward and just have a check-in.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>And then there’s moments where we just might want to talk as a team about certain
                                decisions that are getting made. I'm very proud of that: those key moments in your
                                company's path where you can make those key decisions together, rather than individuals
                                just making a decision because of speed, or because they feel it's their right.</p>
                            <p>All of this goes together. I hope for us to be very conscientious around maintaining
                                culture, but it's an ongoing challenge for anyone who's running an agency or any company
                                really.</p>

                            <p>That’s a nice position to be in: where you are able to select the clients or partnerships
                                who align to your business’s mission. I don’t think there’s a huge amount of studios
                                currently that are fortunate enough to be in that position. Would you say that that’s
                                your current role in Accept &amp; Proceed: that you are actively the right clients and
                                partnerships for the business?</p>

                            <p>It's a group role. Partnership – as we call it, rather than new business – is something
                                that has been pretty successfully devolved. Everyone in the company has some form of
                                responsibility around it, whether it be spotting an organisation that we think is really
                                interesting, bringing it into the studio to discuss, or actually reaching out directly,
                                or running new business meetings or partnership meetings – these are things that a lot
                                of people within the company have responsibility for, if they are interested in that
                                area of evolving their role.</p>
                            <p>It's an interesting point around clients: yes, we have key sectors: we would love to help
                                innovation that is positive for the planet to scale, and we have a track record of being
                                able to create branding communications that scale companies really, really effectively
                                and innovations really, really effectively. But there's this sort of flip side that
                                we're seeing here, around an interesting part of the conversation that came up when we
                                discussed that opportunity as a team: the fact that you cannot change what you do not
                                engage with. What might be perceived to be an organisation that is not aligned with your
                                values could become one – if they're committed and if you have access to the
                                changemakers within the organisation, the combination of the CEO and the CMO. If you're
                                working directly with them on a strategy that is then going to be rolled out and
                                deployed throughout an entire company, you can make serious change – and more impactful
                                change – to companies that are perceived to be some of the ‘worst’ on the planet.</p>
                            <p>Would you not rather have a positive effect with one of the ‘baddies’, if you like, in
                                order to be able to really prove this position of ‘design for the future’; really prove
                                this position of having a positive impact in the world? That's where the most work is
                                needed. We haven't had that decision to make very often, but it is an interesting thing
                                to think about. We're all bound in systems that are fraught with issues. There's not
                                really any clean money on the planet. It's all come through systems, even if it's coming
                                through what seems to be a really worthy organisation that you're working with, it's
                                naïve to think that everything isn't interconnected with each other. I think
                                understanding that everything is interconnected, and really understanding that you can
                                have a massive effect by working in that way, is a very important position to hold. I
                                don't think it's a moral argument that the design agencies should be holding. I think
                                it's more of a survival argument that we should be talking about, really: corporations
                                that are part of that 78%, I mentioned in opening that need to change because they are
                                unviable, because of the way that they're operating, need to evolve quick. So any CEO or
                                CMO working within those organisations should come and speak to me – or maybe come and
                                speak to you – because they need to evolve and they need to evolve quickly. There is an
                                existential threat to their organisation that we can help with.</p>
                            <p>So I suppose I try to have the broadest perspective on this idea of companies that are
                                worthy or not. I try not to be naïve around that. I'm pretty much open to conversations
                                with anyone, but I think the question is, Where can you have access to those that are
                                ready to change?</p>
                            <p>There's this idea of the Bellman curve, which means you need access to 3.5% of any
                                community in order to have that kind of exponential growth effect. So if you think of
                                that 78% of companies that need to evolve, you don't need all of them – we don't want to
                                work with 78% of the companies on the NASDAQ, you just want to work with the 3.5%, which
                                are going to have that cascading effect over time. That's the way we're thinking about
                                our partnerships.</p>

                            <p>It's a nice way to look at it, and I think it goes back to your earlier statement about
                                making the smaller changes – the micro changes that have a greater impact on the macro.
                                This might be a loaded question for you, but which are the sectors that you think have
                                the highest risk and need immediate change for the future?</p>

                        <div class="text_normal">
                            <p>Going back to this idea of a planetary body, I like the metaphor of thinking of our
                                planet as an interconnected singular identity. I think there's things that transcend
                                those geographical borders. When you really think about it, there's a lot of very
                                compelling stories that we just tell ourselves and currently, they're either in their
                                infancy or they're just not serving us well and we need to rethink. If you think of a
                                planet: one those geographical borders is just one of those stories that we tell
                                ourselves. Even money itself – just a story that we tell ourselves.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>I like to kind of think of those sectors as being different parts of the body. For
                                example, an energy company is kind of like the blood circulating through our body. And a
                                sanitation company is kind of like the liver or the kidneys that's breaking down the
                                toxins. Media companies are kind of like the perceptual mechanisms which are converting
                                the data and perception into memes and usable chunks for society to be able to
                                understand. And therefore brand is a function of consciousness in this very profound
                                way. All these different sectors are part of the body that needs help. So, I can't tell
                                you to rush to the heart. I think it all needs to happen kind of simultaneously.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>We're in this moment which I kind of compare to the moment through the 60s and 70s where
                                you had these counterculture movements, and a lot of experiments with psychedelic drugs,
                                and it was producing some truly enlightened business leaders. I kind of put people like
                                Steve Jobs into that category – and I know that he's a flawed individual in some
                                respects, and there's lots of awareness around the way that he operated, that was pretty
                                ruthless in many ways – but I do think he was a visionary and able to think 15 to 20
                                years ahead of what he was actually working on in that moment. And I think at that
                                moment, we had this kind of raising consciousness that was really happening around the
                                globe. But the door was kind of slammed shut for various reasons on those
                                movements.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>And now what we have is that time again: I feel it's kind of like a global renaissance
                                that we're going through, but with the amplified ability through technology to better
                                understand ourselves, better understand, with the evolution of quantum understanding and
                                advancement of technologies like AI, we have a deeper better understanding and potential
                                of who and what we are.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>So you kind of have this trio in my mind of advancement of technology, renaissance, but
                                crisis –&nbsp;which means we literally cannot fail in this moment, otherwise we are
                                doomed. It certainly focuses the attention! Whatever access point you have moves the
                                dial. I don't want to pick any one sector because I would like to encourage every
                                designer, anyone working in any particular sector, to think about where they can move
                                the whole in the positive direction, because we all have agency in this respect.</p>

                            <p>I think for me it's a matter of looking into, “Are you excited about the future? Are you
                                scared for the future?” And that's a conversation that we've been having a lot with
                                people outside of the studio. The conversation is steering more towards fear and people
                                are scared for multiple reasons, because of security, or security of jobs and a
                                multitude of all these little elements that are nearly spiralling out of control because
                                no one's got the reins really. Would you say you’re excited for where the future is
                                going? Or are you a little bit more scared?</p>

                            <p>&nbsp;I try not to operate from a place of fear and that's because it hampers the
                                creative process on a basic level. I think that when you're in a state of anxiety and
                                fear, it's just impossible to really live in the joy of creation. There's a
                                contradiction in those two things that I try not to live with, but I do think that a lot
                                of this is because we're fearful – because the systems that we were brought up in are
                                failing. We have certain understandings of things like what it is to be a success: to be
                                a success is to earn a certain amount of money, or to own a certain amount of things. I
                                think reframing what success actually is is part of the journey. We need to go on in
                                this moment. So we're sitting here, I've no idea how old your clothes are, for example,
                                but the reflection of success should be who's got on the oldest clothes, in some
                                respect. And I know certain parts of this is happening. But if I'm sitting here – I do
                                not, unfortunately, have a piece of clothing, that's 20 years old – but if I'm sitting
                                here in a top, that's 20 years old, you should be like, “Wow! That's super cool.</p>
                            <p>How did you do that?” And I should be rewarded for that. But we’re not – we wear our best
                                clothes and that's just one tiny example of this idea of what success actually means. So
                                I think that we've been brought up in this sort of mindset and worldview of competition.
                                But in fact, where we need to get to is a place of cooperation, and if we can reframe
                                what success actually looks like for organisations, if we can really start to unpick
                                what the opportunity in this moment is, it's like no other group of humans has ever
                                experienced. I do think that in those conversations that you're having, you should be
                                encouraging those you're speaking to to truly accept themselves: to truly accept the
                                organisation for what it currently is, and accept the challenge ahead of them that we
                                now face. Because I think there's this sort of magic that comes when you see opportunity
                                and you accept the position that you're in as a starting point of something much, much
                                bigger and greater for the future.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>I think now is the time to reimagine. It's really our moment, a society and as humanity,
                                and as individuals and companies to really create a new world. So I'd really like to
                                celebrate the moment that we're in, and recognise that it's a moment that no other group
                                of humans has ever had, and really think, can we create a more beautiful world together?

                                sure that the decisions we make now will have a good impact on the future. Do you think

                            <p>I mean, I just don't have a crystal ball, but I do think we have to be honest with each
                                other in these moments. So, I accept the fear, I accept the anxiety. I accept that the
                                path will likely be rocky ahead – and I think we all need to recognise that. I suppose
                                that one concern is that with the advancement of technology and the way that media is
                                currently consumed at scale, it's kind of making the virtual realm more attractive in
                                some respects to the fearful, anxious narrative of our potential future in the real
                                world. And what we need to do is have something that kind of shocks us out of the
                                distraction. It's a kind of war for attention that we're talking about here, and that we
                                have a very, very big opportunity as brand designers and creators of digital content and
                                media. These are the opportunities that we hold to be able to actually kind of bring
                                public people back into the real world. And there has to be something in the real world
                                that shocks us out of the path that could be travelled down, in order for us to escape.
                            </p>
                            <p>In some ways, the new rock ‘n’ roll for younger generations has become activism and I
                                find that really, really interesting. I was brought up in a world where music, and the
                                appreciation of culture, and fashion– the way that youth groups, and communities, really
                                operated was very, very different. And the identity of those groups was very, very
                                different. And now you've got the situation where it feels like there's a bigger story –
                                a more important story. Possibly the most exciting story that we've ever had to engage
                                with around our future is actually the thing that we need to be able to engage with and
                                be able to push things forward with. I don't think there's going to be a light bulb
                                moment where it all just flicks on. It is going to be an evolution, but I do think that
                                thing it's already happening like the world is in chaos, we're having the effects of
                                climate change really dramatically happen around the world.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>So I suppose where I sit, Rogan, on this is: we don't know what's going to happen – like
                                I say, I've got no crystal ball. I will take responsibility for my own actions for my
                                own frequency, if you like. My own vibration. If we must die, if we are going down the
                                path of extinction, I want to die at a point where my vibration is the highest it can
                                possibly be, because what comes next will feed from the energy that we leave behind.
                                Energy doesn't go anywhere, it just changes form. So I think we have a responsibility,
                                whether we're going down a really rocky road or whether it be utopia, just to hold
                                ourselves in the highest sort of vibration or the highest state that we possibly can,
                                going into that, and come what may I think that's the responsibility for each individual
                                and human to do that for themselves and for those around them really.</p>

                                <p>It's definitely come later. I think when I was younger I was probably a bit more
                                    selfish, or unaware, or a combination of both those things. I always loved the
                                    potential of design, and I always loved the creative sector, but I didn't really
                                    recognise the detrimental effects that it had on the world. And I think there was
                                    this sort of, raising my awareness, probably with a decline in my selfishness as I
                                    mature and probably having kids, started thinking about future generations in a more
                                    profound way. And I think the combination of those things like the recognition of –
                                    albeit well-intended – the detrimental effects that the work we've done over the
                                    years, have had on the planet… Along with this recognition that if you've had that
                                    effect, you can now take responsibility and turn it round.</p>
                                <p>You can use whatever skills you've got, whatever opportunities you've got, whatever
                                    connections you've got, the projects that are coming your way, the platforms you're
                                    part of – all of these things can actually have an incredibly positive effect if you
                                    shift your awareness and your intention. So I think there was definitely a point
                                    where I had a raise in awareness and it shifted my intention – and therefore
                                    attention – and I'd say that was probably bubbling up for the last 10 years or so.
                                    But I think it's become ever more present in the last sort of five or six.</p>

                            <p>It seems the wheels are turning, and things are changing. But for me, it will also go
                                down to key principles and ethical considerations. Do you have any guiding principles?

                            <p>Yes. I think balance is a guiding principle for the way that I run my life, and it's got
                                multiple meanings for me, that word. I think quite early in my career – I consider
                                myself to be entrepreneurial, but I didn't want to be an entrepreneur that was so
                                focused on a mission that it would be to the detriment of every other area of their
                                life. And we all know how that ends up – we have very good examples of those individuals
                                presently. And they achieve a lot – they're incredibly productive – but I think the
                                effect, the kind of vibration they carry, if we go back to that idea, can be very
                                disruptive to the planet. So I think that for me balance is something that I wanted to
                                commit to.</p>
                            <p>I want to make sure that I'm looking after those I love and I'm nurturing the
                                relationships that nourish me. And then, work is very, very important to me, of course
                                but there's ebbs and flows: I've got a stint of travel coming up, which will mean I'm
                                away from my family and working very hard. But I will go through a period of rebalancing
                                after that, and I try and ebb and flow through the year and understand that there's
                                seasons not just in our weather systems but also in your life and throughout the year
                                and the workflow, and all of these different things. Agencies have seasons too, and that
                                can change on an annual basis. So, balance is something I try and hold very dear to
                                myself.</p>
                            <p>I committed really to use the skills that have always seemed to be present in my life of
                                being a catalyst of some sort. I've always been quite good at bringing people together,
                                whether it be connections for a party or an event or a project or a design studio. This
                                is a skill that I seem to have, and I'm quite comfortable with, and I want to use that
                                skill wisely to inspire the world in some way. So I think that's a principle, if you
                                like: to use the network and the things I'm connected to to lead in a really, really
                                positive way. I think that there's this sort of responsibility for us to think about the
                                roles that we have as leaders in creating positive, cascading effects for the future,
                                and I suppose that's a principle by which I wish to live as well.</p>

                            <p>I do think I have a mind that enjoys having lots of things going on at once. I'm
                                constantly spinning plates – and the negative of that is that sometimes I'm not able to
                                give one of the plates the attention it really needs and deserves, but I am very
                                comfortable with multiple plates spinning. I have been reflecting recently that I have
                                got a busy home life, but that busy home life offsets the busy work life. So in a way
                                they do balance each other out, even though it's all busyness: the home life is a kind
                                of balancer of the busy work life.</p>
                            <p>But equally there's certain practices and rituals that I just find very helpful. I'm very
                                interested in breathwork. I practiced meditation for many years, but I found there's
                                something around breathwork that seems to fast track a very profound meditation. I use
                                breathwork to calm myself down before meetings or important moments in my life, and the
                                ability for breath to be able to change your feelings is just profound – that's a
                                superpower in itself. But I also love movement, and I got sort of addicted, should we
                                say, to hand balancing probably four or five years ago now, and that's evolved into just
                                movement. There's something around the way I practise now, which is sort of falling in,
                                and out of handstands, but moving through a sort of animal-like flow in my sessions that
                                just brings me into a flow state, and I try and live my life like that, really like
                                coming into a conversation like this being open and allowing it to flow.</p>
                            <p>I think that's really the way that most humans should try and operate if they can: so I
                                try and live in that state of flow as much as I can. If you do that, I think you can
                                find boundless energy and actually it does feel balanced because you're not overwhelmed
                                by what's about to come or what's just happened, you're sort of living in that moment.
                                So that's something I am a lifelong committed sort of student of, I suppose – mindful
                                practice and living in the present moments – but I'm not pretending I'm where I would
                                like to be with it and it is a struggle sometimes but it's something that helps me a
                                lot.</p>

                            <p>Meditation and breathwork is something that I've learned a lot about in the past,
                                specifically because we've got a client that we helped do branding, and that we’re
                                currently developing an app for that’s in breathwork, so we’ve done a lot of research
                                and we’re still continuously doing a lot of research and through that research and
                                reading books I’ve found a lot of benefits from meditation and breathwork. I think that
                                my issue is sticking to the practice: I tend to kind of stop when things are good, and
                                fall back into my old habits, which is really just the opposite of what I’m meant to be
                                doing!</p>

                            <p>Yeah. I agree. I mean, discipline is key for it. It has an accumulative effect. The more
                                you do things, the more regularly… if you're doing it when you feel great, it will have
                                an accumulative effect and a compound effect over time. So yeah, I just think building
                                those moments into your daily practice are very necessary and I think it's through those
                                kinds of practices that you start to see that we are more than sometimes we are told.
                            </p>
                            <p>We are not individual egos in isolation walking this planet, we are something that's part
                                of something much more special just being able to truly feel the wonders of the
                                universe, which are available to us in any given moment, but we’re sort of hampered by
                                the societal structures and systems within which we live that kind of overwhelm us. But
                                you can break through that: you can recognise that they are, in a lot of cases, kind of
                                illusionary – and you have access to something far greater. And that I think all humans
                                kind of possess a sort of clairvoyant capacity: a sort of expanded awareness capacity
                                and it's something I love.</p>
                            <p>Exploring access to a shared consciousness. I love the idea of this wisdom that can come
                                to you, that you didn't learn through your own life, but you've sort of downloaded in
                                those moments of kind of serene calm that you can access through breathwork or
                                meditation. I think that's next-level humans that are living in that state. And that's
                                what's fascinating to me and I will continue to explore for the rest of my life.</p>

                            <p>Yeah, I think for us, Dash is a young business, we are about five years old this year, so
                                we’re still really in the nurturing stage from a business standpoint. I think one of our
                                biggest principles is continuously learning, and that happens across many areas of the
                                business: internally, learning processes or new skills, teaching other individuals in
                                the business. I think it’s something that everyone within Dash really adheres to and
                                really loves. Another way is always pushing quality work: I think we’re always trying to
                                deliver quality work, I think we’re always trying to deliver to the best of our ability,
                                to deliver the best-quality work that we can. Another one would be bringing empathy into
                                all decision-making: I think that’s a real big one in the studio, and something we all
                                value.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>We’ve got quite a few guiding values within the business, but I’ll pinpoint a couple: I
                                think the first one is “Be the person your dog thinks you are.” That’s something that
                                one of our co-founders said in our first strategy session, and it really resonated with
                                all the partners at the time. Another one is “Leave your ego at the door.” For us that’s
                                all about being humble: everyone is here, everyone wants to help, and everyone is
                                learning from each other.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>To answer your question about the future, and what excites me about the future – I think
                                I’m a very optimistic person, so I am looking forward to it. Obviously there are
                                concerns, but I think if everyone plays their part and does small things to make a
                                bigger change, we are likely to have a brighter future, and I think it excites me. I
                                think where technology is moving at the moment, that excites me. I’m optimistic, and I’m
                                excited for it.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>I’m also really excited for this series: I think there’s a huge opportunity for me to
                                have conversations with founders and creatives and thought-provoking leaders, and have
                                open, candid conversations just like we’ve had today. I value them, I get a lot of
                                enjoyment out of them, and I hope everyone else does, too. I’m continuously looking for
                                content like this, and hopefully peeling back the layers and showing what happens behind
                                closed doors can be beneficial for a few people. So thank you David – I really do
                                appreciate your time, and I’ve loved our conversation, so thank you so much for joining

                                speaking today and “Be the person your dog thinks you are” – that will sit with me for
                                the rest of the week. I like it very much.</p>
