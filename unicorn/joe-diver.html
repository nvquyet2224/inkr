                                people who follow me are people who might be interested in my services (like brand
                                identity or web design), a lot of the people on there are actually individuals who are
                                trying to learn about design, trying to develop their own careers, and gain an
                                understanding of how this industry works.</p>
                            <p>I get a lot of DMs and enquiries where people ask me “What's your creative process?”,
                                “How do you acquire clients?” and things like that. So I really wanted to help those
                                people and I thought the best and easiest way to do that was by releasing a tutorial of
                                some kind. I have a lot in the works that will hopefully be able to help those
                                individuals, such as communities, coaching, and that kind of stuff.</p>
                            <p>Ultimately, I think that sort of idea came from feeling like there was a little bit of a
                                lack of transparency in the industry between this kind of higher level and the bottom. I
                                suppose I just want to, in whatever way I can, bridge that gap, because I know I would
                                have really benefited from that when I was coming up.</p>

                            <p>I think that's one of the reasons why we've started this project, because it's exactly
                                that level of transparency from top to bottom which is needed. I think a lot of it is
                                that people are just trying to understand the process.</p>

                            <p>I've been really pleasantly surprised with the engagement. I think there's definitely an
                                appetite for it and it's great that you guys are doing something similar, and obviously,
                                we're all busy. Every designer is busy and you can only do so much, but I think if we
                                all make an effort to give at least a small percentage of our time to educating others
                                and just kind of try to bridge that gap. I think it's only going to have a positive
                                impact on the industry.</p>

                            <p>It's difficult to say and I think as my career has advanced, I'd say the tide has turned
                                way more towards client work. I think in the beginning when you are trying to develop
                                your style, develop your skill set, self-initiated work probably forms more of a
                                significant part. Back then it was probably a lot higher, but now I'd say maybe I still
                                try and spend about 15 - 20% of my time on self-initiated work, and that's not just
                                creating and designing but also upskilling, taking courses.</p>
                            <p>I'd say that's probably a rough guideline, but I strongly believe in the importance of
                                self-initiated work. I think I did a Twitter thread (or X thread, as I should call it
                                now) about how conceptual and self-initiated work is so valuable for young creatives and
                                inexperienced creatives, because maybe, when you're not getting a flow of jobs coming
                                in, it still provides an opportunity to create and develop your skills and then
                                eventually those clients will come.</p>

                            <p>I agree and often tell juniors exactly that. I think it's the self-initiated work that
                                gets you the jobs, especially when you freelance and you're not picking up nice exciting
                                work that’s portfolio worthy. So the self-initiated work is really the stuff that shows
                                your talent and gets your foot into the client's door.</p>
                            <p>You mentioned earlier that people slide into your DMs, but how do you go about finding
                                new work?</p>

                            <p>It's a real mixture but I think social media is a big part of it. I've always put a lot
                                of emphasis on building an online presence. Whether you like it or not, I feel like it's
                                quite an essential part of running a digital design agency or freelancing. Whether they
                                come through email or DMs, a lot of them come through the presence that I've developed
                                on Instagram and Twitter.</p>
                            <p>However, I think now that I'm a little bit further into my career, a lot of the work I
                                get will be through word of mouth and recurring business. If I've done a web design for
                                someone, they might in two years decide “we’re ready to do the brand identity now”.</p>
                            <p>And then the last one I'd say is I've very recently started working with an agency called
                                <a class="Global_linkRedraw__GxzsY" target="_blank"
                                    href="https://www.appart.agency/">Appart</a>, which you may be aware of. I've known
                                the founder, Phil Bastiaans for around two years and we actually bumped into each other
                                in Vietnam, really weirdly. So that will form a little bit more of my client base as we
                                progress through next year and Q4 this year.

                            <p>It's a kind of collaboration partnership. Phil understands that people like myself, I
                                have my own brand and I have my own work, and the way that I like to do things. And I
                                think if there's a project where he needs my skill set, then it's going to be more of a
                                collaboration rather than any sort of employment or anything like that. It's a
                                collaboration and I love working in a team.</p>

                                stronger when someone's name is associated with the project.</p>

                            <p>What a lot of people probably don't know about me is, as well as being very interested in
                                the design world, a lot of my time I love listening to podcasts and watching YouTube on
                                things like productivity and self-development and all that kind of stuff. I'm just
                                really interested in that kind of thing and what that leads me to do. So I'm always
                                trying different daily routines to see what suits me best.</p>
                            <p>I think as a freelancer and an entrepreneur it's essential that you find something that
                                works really well for you. In terms of my daily structure, I like to wake up fairly
                                early, get some exercise as soon as possible, have a coffee break, and set myself up for
                                the day.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>I try to front-load the hardest and most important tasks in the
                                morning-to-early-afternoon period, take a little break, and then come back to it and do
                                some lighter work, which may involve self-initiated projects or things that are not as
                                pressing.</p>
                            <p>My brain is the sharpest in the morning and early afternoon so I like to take advantage
                                of that and try not to work in the evenings. I was talking to someone the other day and
                                I think some creatives and designers seem to get this spurt of creativity at like 9pm,
                                which can be quite frustrating but sometimes you've got to leverage that if it comes to
                                you.</p>

                                <p>I think I've always been drawn to a very grid-based structure, and quite minimalistic
                                    aesthetics. Whether that be looking at certain furniture or architecture, for
                                    whatever reason, I'm just drawn to quite minimalistic things.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>That said, I also have massive admiration for more traditional, complex designs. I
                                    try to weave those in and create a mixture instead of just being one-dimensional in
                                    terms of where that inspiration came from. I think I was always drawn to the fathers
                                    of Swiss design, people like Josef Müller-Brockmann and Wim Crouwel, and studied
                                    that massively. Especially at the start of my career.</p>
                                <p>I think I then just wanted to try and bring that into the modern world because I saw
                                    how that stuff works in the 50s and 60s. There's no reason why I can't bring that
                                    forward and start implementing it in the modern world - especially in the fashion
                                    space, creative space. I think there's a lot of opportunity for that to be explored.
                                    I've always loved that kind of minimalistic look and I think that's where that came
                                    from.</p>

                            <p>&nbsp;I'd say I'm pretty fluid. It does vary in some ways and I think most designers will
                                understand that. In most cases, you can never really say that in order to get to the end
                                product you need to go: step one, step two, step three, and step four. However, I do
                                follow a rough process in terms of making sure that I reach the place that we're trying
                                to get to.</p>
                            <p>Typically that will revolve around a lengthy mood-boarding and brainstorming process, in
                                which we kind of craft the overall direction of the project. Then, what I'll do once
                                we've established that is kind of go into an initial draft phase which is just me
                                playing around, experimenting and just creating something that I think fits the overall
                                direction of the project. Then, we sit down and review that with the client. Once you've
                                established that, I'll start building the kind of foundational blocks of that brand or
                                project, and sometimes that will revolve around a few revision rounds potentially. Then,
                                from there we develop assets like social media and business cards or billboards or
                                whatever it might be.</p>
                            <p>I think those initial fact-finding stages of brainstorming or mood-boarding,
                                experimenting, and always getting feedback from the client is essential. I'm a big fan
                                of working in short sprints, and not just going all in on your own for two weeks. I
                                think it's important to get feedback along the way.</p>

                            <p>I think the first thing is to not fight it. Everyone gets it, you don't just have to be a
                                designer or artist to get a creative block. I think if you feel that, It's useless
                                fighting it. I think you just need to say, ‘Okay, this has happened. Let me take a
                                break, go for a walk or even take the rest of the day off’, if you can do that - but
                                don't fight it. And I think the more you fight it, the longer it will continue.</p>
                            <p>The other thing I would say is, I think in today's world, there's a real hustle culture
                                and I think people almost gloat about how much they work, like “I work 18 hours a day”
                                and it's like, that might not be the most beneficial way to develop yourself and your
                                career.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>If you don't feel up to working, you shouldn't force yourself to do so and if you feel
                                motivation and inspiration, I think you should really take advantage of that and work as
                                much as you feel like working. But if you don't feel like that, take a couple of days
                                off and that motivation will come back.</p>

                                I actually studied marketing and business. And for whatever reason, I always felt a
                                little bit of inadequacy on that front. Especially as the scope of the inquiries that I
                                was getting increased to larger brands and larger clients. I definitely felt that kind

                                happened quite quickly. I've always designed since I was very young, whether it be just
                                tiny little things on my laptop, or art, or anything like that. And I was taking on
                                freelance clients, but still involved in the marketing world a little bit.</p>
                            <p>It just got to a point where I thought this is what I love, what I feel I am most
                                talented at, and what I enjoy. So I went straight into design just because I absolutely
                                love design. I enjoy every day so it just made sense to me. I didn't fully say goodbye
                                to marketing, though, because I think there is a lot of crossover. I often think some
                                designers maybe lack a little bit of knowledge of marketing because ultimately creating
                                a brand, you should understand their market and their target consumer.</p>

                                think all of that, with a bit of perspective, can be viewed positively. And ultimately
                                that's how you learn. It's important to look at everything with some perspective and

                                <p>I absolutely loved the project because I felt that the founders’ overall creative

                                    was just to come in and refine the brand and tie it all together, and work on the
                                    web design as well. It was just one of the first projects that I did which really
                                    allowed me to express my own creativity and really show people what my creative

                                images until the campaign is released in September but I've been working with RIMOWA, a
                                suitcase company. They're based all over the world and have a new campaign called
                                RE-CRAFTED, where they have old suitcases which get returned with unique scratches and
                                are then moulded over and then they resell them. So it's all around reusing products. It
                                was a really cool project. I think to work with a brand of that size is a real honour
                                for me. I'm really looking forward to sharing that in September when the adverts are to
                                be going out in German newspapers (I think).</p>

                                Instagram, but I’m working with a company called Holiday Club. They're based in London
                                and they are providing education to young creatives in the inner London areas. I've been
                                doing some design workshops with them, giving them a bit of transparency in the industry
                                and a few tips and tricks on how to develop their own careers.</p>

                                doing. Do you have any plans to get more involved with lecturing or even mentoring

                            <p>I have set up a company called BCDFLOW. The aim is to release products tailored to
                                helping designers looking to advance their career. The name stems from the pillars I
                                believe are essential for a successful career as a designer. 'B' is for Business as I
                                believe a strong foundational&nbsp;knowledge of business and marketing is a fundamental
                                component of being a designer. 'C' is for community, which is why I have set up the
                                BCDFLOW Community available through the bio in my Instagram. 'D' is for design, where I
                                teach the principles of design which&nbsp;have allowed me to reach the point I am now.
                                The last word is 'FLOW'. This is a play on the 'flow state' I love to enter when
                                working. I find myself in a state of utter focus and control when working. Setting up
                                your office, workstream and life to reach this state is something I think we should all
                                strive for. I will also be releasing more free educational content in future as well.

                            <p>But listen, I'm not gonna come on here and say I don't care about money because obviously
                                it's a big part of everyone's career choices and how much they work and all this kind of

                                much rather be earning less and working on something I care about than earning a lot
                                more on something that I absolutely hated.</p>

                            <p>You know what, I think most people would probably say Nike or Adidas. I'm actually going
                                to pick a much smaller company based in the UK, which may be a really boring answer
                                actually Rogan, so I apologise. They're definitely making some waves in the luxury
                                fashion scene now in the UK. They're called <a class="Global_linkRedraw__GxzsY"
                                    target="_blank" href="https://www.colebuxton.com/">Cole Buxton</a> and they’re an
                                apparel company.</p>
                            <p>I just absolutely love their overall aesthetic so I think working with them in some kind
                                of capacity would be a real dream for me. You probably weren't expecting that kind of
                                answer but I would say Cole Buxton is a massive one.</p>

                                are you the kind of person that approaches them and messages them on Instagram or
                                LinkedIn, or do you kind of just let it go and just hope that they can potentially find
                                you at some stage?</p>

                            <p>In the past, I have reached out to a couple brands and a couple artists and I made a
                                video about one of them. An artist called Black Sam, that I reached out to, ended up
                                becoming an amazing project to work on. I think in the future, I might, because if I
                                have a spare month where I'm not booked, I would love to work with them in some kind of
                                capacity. It's important to be able to sell yourself and reach out to brands if you're
                                passionate about working with a particular brand. It can work sometimes and it
                                definitely has done for me in the past.</p>
                            <p>There was one where I reached out to someone, and they said thanks for the message and
                                then nothing happened for about seven months. Then they said “I've got this new album,
                                can we work on that?” And that's how that happened. So you've got to be patient.</p>

                            <p>I've got to say that's <a class="Global_linkRedraw__GxzsY" target="_self"
                                    href="https://dashdigital.studio/">DashDigital</a> first, of course. I honestly
                                absolutely love your work. I think you're putting out some amazing stuff recently, I saw
                                your project <a class="Global_linkRedraw__GxzsY" target="_self"
                                    href="https://dashdigital.studio/case-studies/lemkus">Lemkus</a> the other day. I
                                love your overall aesthetic. One of the biggest things I love about you guys is the way
                                you showcase your work on social media, and on your website as well.</p>
                            <p>In terms of the others, I’d say it’s always been <a class="Global_linkRedraw__GxzsY"
                                    target="_blank" href="https://mouthwash.studio/">MOUTHWASH</a>. I think that they're
                                a very popular one now and a lot of people will say MOUTHWASH, but they seem to be just
                                a level above at the moment. I think they're just absolutely amazing. The clients they
                                get and the way they treat them all very differently, yet within their cool clean style
                                is very impressive.</p>
                            <p>There's also one called <a class="Global_linkRedraw__GxzsY" target="_blank"
                                    href="https://querida.si/">Querida</a>, which is another agency. They're really cool
                                and putting out some really nice work, very different as well. It's not always so clean.
                                Sometimes it's quite unique and developed in places and I love the way they work
                                photography, so they're definitely one. And then <a class="Global_linkRedraw__GxzsY"
                                    target="_blank" href="https://somethingspecialstudios.com/">Something Special
                                    Studios</a> is another one.</p>
                            <p>There are so many freelancers that I love because I'm always talking to freelancers and
                                learning from them. There's just so many people I take inspiration from. My saved
                                section on Instagram and Pinterest is just ridiculous. I have so much work saved there.
                                I'm just constantly absorbing things.</p>
                            <p>I think we both probably agree that it's a great industry to be a part of, because
                                there's always so much development. Always so much innovation. And I think the industry
                                is great in the sense that it's very positive. People responding when people post work
                                and providing feedback and sharing what they like or don't like about things. There's
                                probably not many industries in the world that are as supportive. While I do say that we
                                need to work on transparency and helping each other, I think we are quite a tight-knit
                                industry.</p>
